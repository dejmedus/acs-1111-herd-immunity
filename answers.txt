What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

- Population Size: 100,000
- Vaccination Percentage: 90%
- Virus Name: Sniffles
- Mortality Rate: 70%
- Reproduction Rate: 25%
- People Initially Infected: 10

`python3 simulation.py 100000 0.9 Sniffles 0.70 0.25 10`

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
9%

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
6.3%

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
862,219
